Welcome to our secure file sharing utility! This HTML-based tool allows you to
easily encrypt, share, and decrypt files using the CMS (Cryptographic Message
Syntax) standard, PWRI (password recipient info) and AES-256-GCM encryption.

## üîê Features

-   **Encrypt Files**: Select a file, enter a password, and the tool will generate
    a standalone HTML file that contains the encrypted data.
-   **Share Securely**: Share the generated HTML file with your recipient, who can
    then decrypt the file using the same password.
-   **Decrypt Files**: The recipient can use the standalone HTML file to decrypt
    the CMS payload and access the original file.
-   **Local Processing**: All encryption and decryption operations are performed
    locally in the browser, ensuring your data never leaves your device.
-   **Standalone HTML**: The encrypted and decrypted files are self-contained HTML
    files, making them easy to share and use.
-   **AES-256-GCM**: The utility uses the secure AES-256-GCM cipher to encrypt
    your files, providing strong protection for your data.
-   **Standards-based**: By using the CMS standard, this tool avoids "reinventing
    the wheel" and allows interoperability with other file encryption tools.
-   **No Installation Required**: This utility can be used directly in your web
    browser, without the need for any additional software installation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Using this secure file sharing utility is simple:

1. **Encrypt a File**:

    - Open the HTML file in your browser.
    - Select the file you want to encrypt.
    - Enter a password to protect the file.
    - Click the "&#x1f4be;&#xfe0e; Save" button.
    - The tool will generate a new HTML file containing the encrypted data.

2. **Share the Encrypted File**:

    - Share the generated HTML file with your recipient.

3. **Decrypt the File**:
    - Your recipient can open the HTML file in their browser.
    - They will be prompted to enter the password you provided and will need to
      click on the "Next &#x2192;" button to decrypt the file and confirm details
      before downloading.
    - Clicking on the "&#x1f4be;&#xfe0e; Download" button will download the
      original file.

That's it! Your file is now securely shared, and the recipient can access the
decrypted content.

## üîí Security Considerations

This utility is designed with security in mind. By using the CMS standard, PWRI,
and AES-256-GCM encryption, your files are protected during the sharing process.
Additionally, all encryption and decryption operations are performed locally in
the browser, so your data never leaves your device.

**Password Strength Matters**: The strength of the encryption and overall
security of this tool _greatly_ depend on the strength of the password you
choose. We recommend using a strong, unique password to protect your files.
Weak or compromised passwords can put your data at risk.

We cannot guarantee that this tool will be free from bugs, vulnerabilities, or
other issues that could compromise the security of your data. The strength of
the encryption and the overall security of this tool ultimately depend on
factors outside of our control, such as the strength of the password you choose,
the security of your web browser, and the overall security of your computing
environment.
